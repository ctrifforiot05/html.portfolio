<p>Hello, I'm Christian Trifforiot.</p>
  
<p>A bit about me: I hail from the beautiful city of Paris, France, but I've spent most of my life in the Bay Area.</p>

<p>My academic journey has been diverse—I hold a Bachelor of Arts degree in psychology and a Master's in education. Professionally, I've worn many hats, from hospitality to construction, and I've dedicated a significant portion of my career to mentoring teens and college students. For the past decade, I’ve worked in education, specifically in promoting inclusion for both typical and neurodiverse students.</p>
  
<p>I've had a varied role in the field, starting as a paraprofessional, teaching multiple grade levels, and eventually stepping into leadership as the director of the Life Skills Pathway program. My introduction to programming stemmed from the desire to make education more accessible and captivating using technology. It's all about asking, "What can I create to deepen my students' love of learning?"</p>
  
<p>In my free time, I love spending time with my family and staying active. Backpacking, running, hiking, and spending time outdoors are my escapes. I enjoy anything where I can use my creativity and I’m deeply committed to supporting the special needs community.</p>
  
<p>Let's connect and share our love for learning and the great outdoors!</p>
